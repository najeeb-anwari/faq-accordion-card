## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I am still not comfortable with background image positioning, but still want do more practices to master it. I am good at flexbox but I still need to practice my grid skills.
I also faced a problem with transitioning the height which was weird. But this amazing post helped me.
